# Graphter
A generic data management framework.

Your data is not so special. Graphter allows humans to manage _any_ data structure, starting with its own configuration files.

1. Generic - compose any data structure from primitive data types
1. Modular & Swappable - just a series of interfaces with some pre-built implementations
1. Customisable - easily take control where needed
1. Frontend agnostic - it manages data, what you do with it is up to you

## Packages
1. [Core](packages/core/README.md) - framework interfaces
1. Renderers - iterates model configuration and renders CMS UI
    1. [React](packages/renderer-react/README.md)
    1. Angular (roadmap)
1. Node Renderers - a basic set of content types (e.g. string, object, list, html text, etc...)
    1. [React](packages/renderer-component-library-react/README.md)

## Short term priorities
[Why bother having anything else?](./docs/short-term-priorities.md)

## Medium term plan
Start throwing different data management scenarios at it and iterating as stresses are found and remedied.

For example:
1. CRM
1. Risk assessment workflows 
1. Inventory management
1. Invoicing and timesheeting 
1. 2D canvas systems (e.g. Mural) 
1. Media library management

## Long term
Provide managed solutions of the open source tooling.
